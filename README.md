# Music-Genra-Classifiaction
Audio processing is one of the most complex tasks in data science as compared to image processing and other classification techniques. One such application is music genre classification which aims to classify the audio files in certain categories of sound to which they belong. The application is very important and requires automation to reduce the manual error and time because if we have to classify the music manually then one has to listen out each file for the complete duration. So To automate the process we use Machine learning and deep learning algorithms
